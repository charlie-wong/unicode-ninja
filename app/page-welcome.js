			<h1>Welcome to unicode.ninja</h1>
			A tool to help explore the Unicode Basic Multilinqual Plane <pre>U+0000</pre> to <pre>U+FFFF</pre>. 
			Roughly 137,374 characters of excitement! Probably useful for typeface designers, or regular humans 
			looking for those funky characters that you saw on the internet that one time.

			<h2>Get started</h2>
			Select a Character Range using the checkboxes on the left, or search for characters by name using 
			the search bar up top.  Clicking an individual character tile or row will bring up more details 
			and releated characters.  Individual characters can be favorited so you can get back to them 
			quickly later.
